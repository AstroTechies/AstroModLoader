* Added automatic detection for server mode. If an executable file named AstroServer.exe is located in the current working directory, server mode is automatically enabled.
* Added an indicator that displays if a hash mismatch is detected with the Steam API DLL. This indicator does not affect usage of the mod loader itself.
* Added more robust game and local data path correction and verification.
* Fixed a bug where the current paths would not switch properly when the platform is changed in specific scenarios.
* Fixed a bug where the mod loader would crash on switching versions in specific scenarios.

* Upgraded the bundled AstroModIntegrator copy to 1.2.0.
* Added automatic detection for server mode. If an executable file named AstroServer.exe is located in the current working directory, server mode is automatically enabled.
* Added the "Refuse mismatched connections" option, which determines whether or not a game host should kick modded clients with a mismatched set of mods.
* Added the optional mods column in server mode, which allows dedicated servers to select which mods should be enforced.
* Added an indicator that displays if a hash mismatch is detected with the Steam API DLL. This indicator does not affect usage of the mod loader itself.
* Added more robust game and local data path correction and verification.
* Fixed a bug where specific mods would fail to sync.
* Fixed a bug where the mod loader would not update to display downloadable mod versions until auto-updating is complete.
* Fixed a bug where the current paths would not switch properly when the platform is changed in specific scenarios.
* Fixed a bug where the mod loader would crash on switching versions in specific scenarios.

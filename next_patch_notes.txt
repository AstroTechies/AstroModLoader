* Added auto-extraction of .zip files upon auto-update or drag-and-drop installation.
* Fixed a bug where the mod loader would crash when an index file disagrees with a mod on its version.
* Fixed a bug where sometimes the mod integrator would fail to account for new mods automatically copied from the Paks folder.
* Fixed a bug where mods present in the Paks folder but not the Mods folder and mods dragged-and-dropped into the window would be erroneously disabled by the loader.
* Fixed a bug where auto-updating mods would download new versions but not immediately apply them when the mod loader boots up.
* (Hopefully) fixed a bug where the loader would erroneously detect the game as being open when it is not.
* Fixed several bugs where multiple threads would attempt to change UI elements at the same time.
